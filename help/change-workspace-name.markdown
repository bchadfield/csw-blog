The workspace\'s name is displayed on the left of the top header.

Only admins can change a workspace\'s name.

To change a workspace\'s name:

1.  Go to Settings and click on
    the Workspaces tab. This tab displays all the workspaces in your
    account.
2.  Click the \'Edit\' button on
    the right side of the table that corresponds with the workspace you
    want to change.
3.  Enter the new workspace
    name. For clarity it is best to name the workspace after the
    team or client using the workspace.
4.  Click Save.

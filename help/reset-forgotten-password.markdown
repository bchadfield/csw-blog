2.  Click the \'[Reset password][2]\' link.
3.  Enter your CS Workflow user account email.
4.  Click the \'Reset password\' button.
5.  A link will be sent to your
    email; follow the link. This is a secure URL specific to your
    account and will expire after two hours. If your link has expired
    you will need to restart the process.
6.  Enter and confirm your new
    password. Passwords must be longer than 6 characters.

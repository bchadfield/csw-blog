CS Workflow has launched! We're now taking sign ups through the website.

We launched the beta 5 months ago, which feels like just yesterday. In that time we've had amazing feedback and support. Thank you everyone who took the time to check out CS Workflow and a special thanks to everyone that gave us feedback.

## Plans and pricing
We've created three generous plans: Freelancer, Agency and Team.

Choosing the right plan depends on who approves and reviews your content

If you work with different people on different pieces of content (e.g. multiple clients), the right plan depends on the size of the approval teams you work with.

If you only have a couple of approvers: the Freelancer plan is for you.

More people than that: the Agency plan is what you'll need.

If all your content usually goes through the same reviewers and approvers: the Team plan is the way to go.

### Freelancer
*FREE*

- Up to 5 workspaces (each workspace supports 1 client or team)
- Up to 3 users per workspace
- Unlimited content, content types, preview templates, and integrations

The user limit allows for you to have a reviewer and an approver in your client's company.

### Team
*$65 per month*

- 1 workspace for your team
- Unlimited users
- Unlimited content, content types, preview templates, and integrations

On the Team plan there’s no restriction on team size, so you can include as many people as you need. One workspace will be able to handle the content needs of your whole team.

### Agency
*$245 per month*

- Unlimited workspaces (each workspace supports 1 client or team)
- Unlimited users per workspace
- Unlimited content, content types, preview templates, and integrations

With the Agency plan you have the ability to set up workspaces for each of your clients. Each workspace is a secure area meaning clients won’t be able to see each other's content.

## What's next
We're really happy with how CS Workflow solves the problem of content reviews and approvals. But that is just the start. We'll be adding support for more publishing platforms and covering more areas of the content workflow.

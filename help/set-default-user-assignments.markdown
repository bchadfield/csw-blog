Default user assignments can only be set by admins.

Default user assignments determine when a team member is automatically
assigned to new content.<span style="line-height: 1.42857143;" /> <span
style="line-height: 1.42857143;">This will save you from having to set
the user assignments \[link to user assignments\] for every content item
that is created.

New team members are added to the default user assignments.<span
style="line-height: 1.42857143;">  


To set default user assignments:



1.  Go to Team.
2.  Check the boxes on the left
    of the table of those team members you want assigned to new
    content.
3.  Click the \'Save default
    assignments\' button.

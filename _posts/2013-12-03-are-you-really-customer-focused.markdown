I was watching QI the other night and Stephen Fry posed the age old question: if a tree falls down in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound? For those of you not familiar with <a href="http://qi.com" target="_blank">QI</a>, it's a panel show that debunks facts and and replaces them with the unlikely truth (in often full-blown hilarity). The tree in the forest got me thinking: if content goes live and no one sees it, does it actually exist? What the fallen tree and content have in common is that they both need a receiver to validate their existence. A message can only be communicated if there is an audience to engage with it. So the questions is: who is your content's audience and are you engaging them?

If you're creating content for a business then your likely audience are prospects or customers or both. This creation of content will be aimed at generating responses from the audience that help the business achieve specific outcomes, e.g. sales, brand awareness. This is a simple and well-known strategy and yet it can sometimes be lost in the panic to get content live.

The path to getting content live can often be a series of wrong turns and dead ends in the form of reviews and approvals. For the content creator it can be like driving a bus where all the passengers are backseat drivers, each trying to get their 2 cents in and basically telling them how to do their job. It's no wonder then that in order to keep the peace and get to point B the content creator deviates from their original route. Overloaded copywriters (and what copywriters aren't these days) can make massive concessions to reviewers and approvers to keep content moving towards the go live deadline. In some organisations this can even be a normal and expected part of the content process. In this context it's easy to see how the content's audience can be forgotten in favour of appeasing a business' internal stakeholders, aka those pesky backseat drivers. And don't think that this problem is limited to in-house content creators. Freelancers and agencies can also get caught in the trap of treating their clients as the audience.

This problem is really down to having non-cohesive processes and unclear business priorities. Common goals and a collective understanding of them should lie at the heart of a business' content strategy. Halvorsen & Rach place the business' core strategy at the centre of their <a href="http://blog.braintraffic.com/2011/03/brain_traffic_lands_quad/" target="_blank">content strategy quad</a>. It is that which guides all initiatives and decision making. It is clearly also a great way of getting people on board. Want to know why we need to get this content live? Because it ties in closely to the business' goal of building their industry reputation. Want to know why you need to look at this now? Because this content is aimed at increasing sales before the next financial quarter.

Fantastic, so you've got people looking at the content when you need them to. It's a good start but it's not going to guarantee you create great content. Halvorsen & Rach remind us that one of the most important concepts behind their content strategy quad is the interplay between the five areas of substance, structure, workflow, governance and core strategy. None work in isolation of the others and changes to one area will have a flow on effect. The key role of a business' content strategy will be to connect the content components of the quad to the people components. The synergy between these areas will impact on how you will achieve your content goals. So when you've worked out what your content goals are and what form the content will take you would be asking yourself questions like:

- What resources do I need to achieve the content goals?
- Who do I need to get involved?
- Are there tools that could help me manage the process?

Finding the answers to the questions requires collaboration. No man is an island and certainly a good content strategy is the same. The people you will need to be involved are the same people who should be consulted about how your content strategy will be implemented. Their level of understanding of the rationale behind decisions is directly proportional to their compliance. Let them help you create clear expectations of everyone in the process.

And here's where we come to keeping your content customer focused. The content strategy you've created should translate to clear guidelines for your reviewers. A good content strategy will also resolve any disputes by being a source of truth. It's the road map which always displays the right route and stands up to any backseat drivers.

---

In time for Christmas, we've moved CS Workflow into beta. Thank you to everyone that has given feedback, helping us get to this point. Without this CS Workflow wouldn't be possible so we really appreciate it.


### What does this change mean for you?
If you were part of the alpha then you have been migrated to the beta. It's business as usual. You will notice that the URL redirects from <a href="http://alpha.csworkflow.com">http://alpha.csworkflow.com</a> to <a href="https://app.csworkflow.com">https://app.csworkflow.com</a>.

If you have an invite to the alpha you haven't accepted yet, that invite is still valid and will redirect you to the beta.


### What's been happening?
November has been a really busy month for us. There has been a lot of behind the scenes work and here are some highlights:

- Updated <a href="http://csworkflow.com" target="_blank">our website</a>
- Launched <a href="http://csworkflow.com/blog" target="_blank">our blog</a>
- Built and launched <a href="http://secretsanta.csworkflow.com" target="_blank">Blog Secret Santa</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/blogsecretsanta/goodchildren/members" target="_blank">50 good children</a>
- Lots of fixes to small bugs and design
- New app features that you can read about below


### New features
Since the last update about 6 weeks ago, we've crossed 17 items off our todo list, plus fixed 10 major bugs. Here is a list of the more significant updates:

- Content types: adding preset attributes and rules to content
- Comment improvements: reply to comments and mark comments as completed
- Content management: archiving ability (including bulk archiving) and now able to transfer ownership to another team member
- Support for multiple workspaces
- Help tutorials (we'll be adding to these in the future)


### What's next
Over the next month we'll be working with our beta users to continue making improvements. The aim is to get CS Workflow ready for launch, ensuring we can deliver on our promise of solving content review problems.

This will be our last update for 2013, so we wish you safe and happy holidays.

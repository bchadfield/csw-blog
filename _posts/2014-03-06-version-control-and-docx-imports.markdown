The great news is that your feedback keeps rolling in and we've been kept busy trying to keep up with it. Here are some of the changes we've made to improve your CS Workflow experience:

### Version control
You've always been able to save content as a new version but now you can:

- view your content's past versions;
- compare any two versions; and
- revert to a past version.

You will never lose your content again and you'll be able to keep track of what changes have been made.

### Docx file import
CS Workflow now allows for the uploading of docx files. This function will support basic formatting including bold, italic, underline and headings.

Content imports are available in the draft or edit stages. The file imports to the main editing area only (other content attributes are not updated).

### CSW bot
It's now possible to road test CS Workflow without the need to set up a team. The CSW bot is a virtual team member who can review and approve content.

To enable this function, go to the Overview, click 'Get some guidance' located in the top alert notice, then click the link to check out the workflow by yourself. This will add a bot user that will respond to your requests.

Any communications sent to the bot will also be sent to you allowing you to see what happens at the recipient's end.

### Wordpress post editing from CS Workflow
CS Workflow currently allows you to publish directly to your Wordpress blog. We've improved this by enabling you to edit and update your blog once it's live. Exporting approved changes to content already exported to Wordpress will update the post rather than create a new post. This will support any changes including changing the scheduled publish time.

### Coming up...
The feature currently being developed is in-context previewing. Team members will be able to get a better understanding of what the content will look like when it is live.

To do this, CS Workflow will be supporting uploaded templates (HTML, CSS). We will provide some default preview templates for things like social updates and ads that have common styles and layouts.

Only admins are able to edit content types.

To edit an existing content type:

1.  Go to Settings and click on the Content types tab.
2.  Click on the content type you want to edit. This can be done by
    either clicking on the name of the content type or the Edit button
    that corresponds with the content type.
3.  Edit the content type by [adding or removing the properties](/help/content-types/add-content-type.html) you want.
4.  Click the \'Save content type\' button to confirm your changes.

Now when you add the content type to a content item the updated
properties will be applied.

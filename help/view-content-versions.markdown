Any team member is able to view past versions of their content.

To view a past version:

1.  Open the content item you want to view.
2.  Click on the Versions tab on the right (located next to the Comments
    and Activity tabs).
3.  Select the version you want to view.

You will be able to see the body text, content type attributes and
workflow stage.

You are also given the options to compare and revert to past versions.

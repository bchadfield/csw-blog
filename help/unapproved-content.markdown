Content can be moved to the Ready or Live stages without approval. This
gives you flexibility in cases where approval is not required.

Examples of this type of content
would be content that is already live, has no associated risk (e.g.
internal email), and when content has been entered into CS Workflow for
storage purposes only.

Content in the Ready or Live stages that hasn\'t been approved is
flagged as not being approved. This is indicated by an ! in the
content\'s coloured stage label.

CS Workflow uses [Gravatar][1] to enable users to create their own
avatar.

Your avatar visually identifies you in the workspace.

If you have a Wordpress.com account:

1.  Go to [gravatar.com][1].
2.  Sign in.

If you don\'t have a Wordpress.com account:

1.  Go to [gravatar.com][1].
2.  Follow the links to create an account (Create your own gravatar).
3.  Enter your email (should be the same as your CS Workflow email),
    username and password.
4.  Confirm your sign up when you receive the email.

After you have signed in/created an account, follow the link to add a
new image.

Choose where you want to get your image from and upload. Crop the image
and rate the appropriateness of your image (G, PG, R, X).

The image will now be associated with your email address and will appear
in CS Workflow.

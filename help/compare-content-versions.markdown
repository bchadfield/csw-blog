Comparing two versions of the same content allows you to see the
differences between them. You can compare any two versions of the same
content.

To compare versions:

1.  Open the content item with the versions you want to compare.
2.  Click the Versions tab located on the right of the screen.
3.  Click the \'compare\' link of the version you want to compare.
4.  You will have a choice as to which version you want to compare
    against. Click the \'compare with version\' link of the version you
    wish to compare against.

A new page will load showing the marked up differences between the
versions. Content that has been added will appear green and content that
has been deleted will appear red and struck through.

You have three view options on this new page: Comparison (will show
marked up changes) and a view of the versions you selected to compare.

Happy new year! To celebrate the start of what is surely to be a fantastic year, we’re releasing our new workflow into the beta. To explain these changes we’ve created a video that takes you through how the new workflow works.

### New workflow stages
Some stages of the workflow have been changed to better represent their actions. The stages are now: Parked, Draft, Review, Edit, Approval, Ready and Live.

The new workflow allows for distinct review and approval stages. During review, only reviewers review the content and make comments. During approval Approvers are able to submit feedback and request changes.

### More flexibility
Admin and Editors now have more powers to move content through the workflow. At any time prior to the Ready stage, content can be moved around the workflow to any stage. For example, content can go straight to approval from edit, thereby skipping the review stage. This new flexibility allows you to change up the workflow depending on your content and business needs. CS Workflow assists you to minimise the risks of publishing content and won’t allow any content to move to Ready until it has been approved.

### New workflow stage dropdown
A new dropdown button has been added to content pages. Users can access the dropdown to find out what stage content is in. The dropdown will also indicate to editors and admin what stages the content can to moved to. For example, content that is in the draft stage can to moved to Edit, Review or Approval via the dropdown.

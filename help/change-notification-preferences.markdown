CS Workflow uses email
notifications to keep team members updated about content they are
assigned to.

There are three types of notifications:

* **Comments:** A notification is sent when someone adds a comment to
  content you own and when someone replies to your comment.
* **Content updates:** Content owners and assigned team members are
  notified when their content moves to a different stage in the
  workflow.
* **Requests:** Assigned team members are notified when content is ready
  to edit, review or approve.

You can manage how often you receive notifications:

* Immediately: An email notification will be sent whenever an action
  requires it (this is the default for requests).
* Daily: Daily digests are sent once a day if you have any notifications
  and combine all three types of notifications (this is the default for
  content updates and comments).
* Never: You will not be notified of any event.

 To change your notification preferences:  


1.  Click on your name or user
    avatar at the top of the left navigation bar.
2.  Select Notification
    preferences to display the Notification preferences form. This
    displays your preferences for all the workspaces of which you are a
    member.
3.  Change your preferences using
    the drop down options.
4.  Click Save to set your
    preferences.

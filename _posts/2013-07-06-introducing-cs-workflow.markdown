Sick of having to chase, follow up and undo other people’s changes to your copy? Do you need a way to track a document’s versions and changes as it progresses towards final approval? Are you constantly wishing for a way to make content review more transparent?

Welcome copywriters and content wizards to CS Workflow! At CS Workflow we’re focused on fixing one of the main headaches of content production: content review and approval. We understand that getting final approval for copy can be a painful and prolonged process for copywriters. Our aim is to empower copywriters. Getting the feedback and information you need to write great content should be one thing: simple.

Creating great content is all about having the right information, enthusiastic stakeholders and a workflow that supports each team member in their role. CS Workflow aspires to be a simple and intuitive workflow system which helps do just that. We’re developing a way of allowing the stakeholders in content production to interact with content in a way that is meaningful to the team, and most importantly drives the process forwards.

How will we do this? With your help! We will launch a closed beta and invite keen copywriters to trial and test our product. In helping us you’ll be able to benefit from a new workflow system that streamlines and organizes your WIP and in addition, contribute to the development of a product that may revolutionise and standardise the way online content is commissioned and reviewed.

Allow me to introduce ourselves: we’re Vicky Claringbull and Ben Chadfield, a husband and wife team with experience in publishing, product development, online marketing and a shared passion for the web and the content that drives it.  The CS Workflow initiative was driven by our ever-increasing realisation that in today’s world, creating good content has never been more important nor problematic.  In speaking with colleagues and friends about this issue we uncovered one common source of frustration. And hence, CS Workflow was born. We want, over the next few months, to find a solution to this problem and we hope that you’ll come on this journey with us. So stay tuned and primed, CS Workflow is on its way!

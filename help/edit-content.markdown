Content can only be edited by the content owner and assigned editor(s).

To assign an editor to your content \[link to assigning users to
content\] click the + button at the top right of the screen and add the
editor to the content item. You can also set editors in your default
assignments. \[link to default assignments\]

When you are ready to move your content to the editing stage, click on
the coloured drop down menu at the top of the content box and click
\'Edit\'.

Manually moving the content to the editing stage does two things:

1\. Notifies the assigned editor that there is content ready for them to
edit.

2\. Creates a new version of the content so that changes can be tracked
against previous versions.

Tip: Add any instructions for your editor to the comments section, e.g.
style guides to be used, SEO requirements, deadlines, etc.

Content automatically re-enters
the editing stage when the review stage has been completed. The
editor or content owner will be able to see reviewer comments and mark
them as complete or reply where relevant. Comment owners are notified
when their comment has been replied to.

Once this second editing stage has been completed, the editor or content
owner can then send the content item for Approval or back to the Review
stage if changes require further review.

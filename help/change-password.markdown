Team members can only change their own password.

Your password is used to login to CS Workflow; it should not be shared.

To change your password:



1.  Click on your name or user
    avatar at the top of the left navigation bar.
2.  Select Change password to
    display the change password form.
3.  Enter your current password
    and confirm your new password.
4.  Click Save.



You\'ll receive an email confirming the password change as a security
measure.

You can reset your password \[link to reset forgotten password\] if
you\'ve forgotten your password and can\'t log in.

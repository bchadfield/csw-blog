A category can be deleted without deleting the content in that category.
Content items that were under a deleted category will still be
accessible in Content.

You can delete a category using one of two ways.

From the list of categories:

1.  Go to Content and click on the Categories tab.
2.  Click the \'Delete\' button on the row corresponding with the
    category you want to delete.
3.  Confirm you want to delete the category.

From the category page:

1.  Go to Content and click on the Categories tab.
2.  Select the category you wish to delete.
3.  Click the \'Delete\' button at the top right corner.
4.  Confirm you want to delete the category.

Content in the deleted category will remain and have the category field
set to blank.

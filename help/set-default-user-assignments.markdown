Default user assignments can only be set by admins.

Default user assignments determine when a team member is automatically
assigned to new content. This will save you from having to set
the user assignments \[link to user assignments\] for every content item
that is created.

New team members are added to the default user assignments.

To set default user assignments:

1.  Go to Team.
2.  Check the boxes on the left of the table of those team members you want assigned to new content.
3.  Click the \'Save default assignments\' button.

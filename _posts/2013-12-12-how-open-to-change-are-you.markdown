About 4 years ago I moved to Melbourne, Australia. Not knowing my way around, I'd asked my housemate at the time the best route to get to my new work.

<p style="margin-left: 20px;">'Do you want to fastest or the easiest route?' he'd asked.</p>

His response surprised me, 'Aren't they the same?' I'd replied. My thinking was, surely the simplest way would be the quickest. But actually, I was wrong (as he then went on to explain). Fast did not always mean easy. Fast meant a few more turns, some insider's knowledge and shortcuts that only a local would know about. Now, I am always happy to do a bit of learning in order to spend less time in traffic, however it reminded me of the situation we often face at work - we'd often rather follow what we consider the simplest process than do that which would be faster or more efficient.

For example, at my previous work, the publishing department would handle about 100,000 individual copyright and permissions requests every year. Sometimes we'd get them in hardcopy, sometimes as email attachments, word files, and even (yes, still!) via the old dusty fax machine. Whatever the format, they would all follow the same process. Any hardcopies would need to be scanned before they could be entered into our database system. There were hours of sorting, file naming and double handling that added up to a lot of frustration and wasted time. Finally after years of doing things this way, they (meaning management) decided to take action - yay! It was almost 2 years of analysing the problem and developing a bespoke solution before a new tool was developed that would radically streamline the process. And after all this do you know what it was met with? You guessed it - resistance and suspicion. It was a classic example of better the devil you know. In this case 'easy' meant the way we've always done it.

Humans are amazing creatures, they are able to adapt to the most insufferable conditions to the extent which they perceive those conditions to be desirable. You need only think of Stockholm syndrome. Now before you start thinking I'm comparing office workers to victims of serious crime, the point I'm trying to make is that people's attitude to change is not always reasonable. Think about the <a href="http://www.buzzfeed.com/tommywilhelm/the-facebook-timeline-of-facebook-backlashes" target="_blank">huge backlash Facebook gets</a> whenever changes are announced. What is reasonable, however, is to expect some resistance, and to plan for it. I'm talking about information sessions, workshops, training and whatever else you can think to get people on board. In hindsight this is probably where my old work went wrong. People knew something was happening but it was very much in the background and it was able to be forgotten about. It's a reminder that what matters here is to get people thinking about change; change not for the sake of change but change for better processes and efficiencies.

People often think they're too busy to even contemplate stopping, observing and evaluating the cause of inefficiencies. It's a bit like going on a diet and never weighing yourself to measure your progress - sure you might feel better being shielded from bad news but you've got no motivation to keep going either.

Measuring how good your processes are doesn't have to be an arduous task. It could be counting how much content went live in the month or gauging the team's energy levels and attitudes. However you choose to measure these, it's equally important to use your results for positive change. Get your team involved and consult with those who will be affected. Set others the example of reflection, taking initiative, of problem solving and continual improvement. A work culture that denies its workers the opportunity for change is one destined to stagnate.

Get into the fast lane; don't be tempted to opt for the easy route.

Integrating with Twitter allows you tweet directly from CS Workflow to
your chosen Twitter account.

Only admins are able to integrate with a Twitter account.

To set up you Twitter integration:

1.  Go to Settings and click on the Integrations tab.
2.  Click on the \'Add Twitter\' button. This will take you to a Twitter
    authorisation page. Make sure you\'re logged into the Twitter
    account you want to publish to.
3.  Click the \'Authorize app\' button.
4.  Assuming everything is fine you\'ll be shown a message saying the
    authorisation has been successful. You\'ll then be automatically
    taken to the page for the integration you just created.
5.  Confirm that the Twitter account you have integrated with is
    correct.
6.  A description of the integration will automatically be generated;
    this can be edited at any time. The description is what will appear
    in the [export options](/help/content/export-content.html). Make sure your
    description is unique and adequately describes the integration.
7.  Click \'Save integration\'.

This Twitter account will now appear as an option in your export drop
down.

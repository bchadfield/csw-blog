Team members of a workspace can only be managed by admins.

To add a team member to the workspace:

1.  Go to Team and click the Add team member button to bring up the team member form.
2.  If the person is an existing user in another workspace in your account, you
    will be able to select them from the drop down. Otherwise, enter the name and email
    of the person you want to add to the workspace.
3.  Set the [roles of your new team member](/help/admin/change-team-members-roles.html).
4.  Click Add to complete the form.

Completing the form will send out an invitation to the workspace to the new team member.

New team members are [assigned by default](/help/admin/set-default-user-assignments.html) to all new content in that workspace.

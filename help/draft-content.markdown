All new content in CS Workflow is placed in the Draft stage (indicated
by the colour grey in the top drop down button).

Once created, content can only be edited by admins and assigned editors.

**Creating content**

There are three ways to create content in CS Workflow:

1\. Import from existing DOCX (.docx) or Markdown (.markdown, .md) file

Click the \'Actions\' button at the top right of the content box and
select \'Import\'. A pop up will appear that will allow to you search
your existing files.

{: style="margin-left: 20px;"}

2\. Copy and paste

Text can be copied and pasted from another word processor into the
content box. Formatted text is supported, including tables and images.
{: style="margin-left: 20px;"}

HTML can also be copied and pasted by switching the content to source
mode (&lt;/&gt; button in the editor toolbar).
{: style="margin-left: 20px;"}


{: style="margin-left: 20px;"}

3\. Writing directly into CS Workflow using our editor.

The CS Workflow editor supports basic WYSWYG formats, including images.

Content can also be added using our HTML editor for more advanced
content formatting.

Once a draft has been created it can then enter the workflow. There are
three options at this point. Content can be <span style="line-height:

\- to edit for collaboration or proofreading
{: style="margin-left: 20px;"}

\- for review
{: style="margin-left: 20px;"}

\- straight to approval
{: style="margin-left: 20px;"}

Tip: For low risk content that doesn\'t need approval you can move it
straight to the Live stage. This will store it as part of your CS
Workflow content library for later reference.

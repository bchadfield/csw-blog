Your account contact details are initially set when the account is
created at sign up.

The account\'s email address is the primary contact method for the
account, including payment notifications. It is important that this
email be kept current.

To change your account content details:

1.  Go to Settings and click on the Account tab.
2.  Click the edit link in the Account details section of the account page to open the Account
    details form.
3.  Make your changes to the contact email and name.
4.  Click Save. This action may take a while to complete because it needs to synchronise with Stripe, our secure
    payment facility.

When it is complete the page will reload, displaying the updated contact details.

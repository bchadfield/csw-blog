Team members can only change their own name or email.

In CS Workflow, your name identifies you and your activity in the
workspace. Your email address is where any notifications are sent.

Tip: Using your full name is optional, but we recommend it for large
teams.

To change your email address or name:

1.  Click on your name or user avatar at the top of the left navigation bar.
2.  Select My profile to display the Edit my details form.
3.  Enter the new name and/or email.
4.  Click Save.

The old email address is sent an email as a security measure. All future notifications will be sent
to the new email address.

Approvers can only approve content that they have been assigned to. The
exception to this is the content owner: content owners cannot approve
their own content.

Content in the Approval stage is unable to be edited. If changes are
required the content needs to be moved back to the Draft or Edit stages.

Where there is a previous version of the content, differences between
the versions are displayed: green indicates additions; red indicates
deletions.

The approver has two options:

1. Approve
To approve content the approver clicks the Approve button.

Approved content automatically moves to the Ready stage. If there are
multiple approvers, all must approve before the content will enter the
Ready stage.

All content approvals are recorded in the Approvals tab in Content.

2. Give feedback
Feedback is given via the comments section. The approver then clicks the
Send feedback button. The content will automatically move to the
Edit stage even if other approvers have yet to submit their
feedback/approval. This avoids wasting an approver\'s time checking
content that another approver is unsatisfied with.

Tip: We recommend only having one approver in your workflow. This should
be the person who is ultimately accountable for published content.

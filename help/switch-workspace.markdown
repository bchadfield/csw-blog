If you are a member of multiple workspaces, <span style="line-height:
1.42857143;">the workspace name in the top left doubles as a drop down
menu.

To switch between your workspaces, click on the workspace name on the
left of the header. A drop down menu will list all the workspaces you
are a member of. This list also acts as an overview by showing you how
much content is in each stage of the workflow.

Select the workspace you want to switch to in the drop down menu.

Deleting a content type from the workspace will not remove it from any
content item that currently references it.

This section will cover both deleting a content type from the workspace
and from a content item.

###  Deleting a content type from a workspace

Only admins are able to delete content types from a workspace.

To delete a content item:

1.  Go to Settings and click the Content types tab.
2.  Click the \'Delete\' button on the right side of the table that
    corresponds to the content type you want to delete.
3.  Confirm that you want to delete this content type.

Deleting a content type from a workspace is a permanent action and
can\'t be reversed.

###  Removing a content type from a single content item

To remove a content type:

1.  Open the content item you wish to change.
2.  Click the \'Actions\' button and select Edit. This will open the
    Edit content form.
3.  Select the blank option in the Content type field.
4.  Click Save.

###  Remove a content type from multiple content items

You can remove the content type of multiple content items using one of
two ways:

* Go to Content, click the Content tab.
* Go to Content, click on the Categories tab and select the category you
  want to make changes to.

For either of these options:

1.  Tick the checkboxes of the content items you want to change.
2.  Click the Selected button.
3.  Click Edit from the drop down. This action will open the Edit
    content form.
4.  Select the blank content type option.
5.  Click Save.

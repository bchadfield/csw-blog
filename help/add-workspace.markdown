This option is only available to accounts on the Freelancer or Agency plans.

Only admins are able to add workspaces.

To add a workspace:

1.  Go to Settings and select the Workspaces tab.
2.  Click the Add workspace button.
3.  Enter the name of the workspace you want to add. For clarity it is best to name the workspace after the team or client using the workspace.
4.  Click Save.

The person adding the new workspace will automatically be added as an admin;
additional [team members will need to be added manually](/help/admin/add-team-members.html).

The new workspace can be accessed in Settings under the Workspaces tab.

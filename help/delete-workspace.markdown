This option is only available to accounts on the Freelancer or Agency plans.

Only admins are able to remove workspaces.

Caution: Removing a workspace permanently deletes all content, tracked
activities and settings. Workspace content will not be able to be
retrieved.

To remove a workspace:

1.  Go to Settings and click the
    Workspaces tab. This tab displays all the workspaces in your
    account.
2.  Click the \'Delete\' button
    in the last column of the table that corresponds to the workspace
    you want to remove.
3.  Confirming that you want to
    remove the workspace will permanently delete all content in that
    workspace.

Your account must have at least one workspace; all attempts to remove an
account\'s last workspace will fail.

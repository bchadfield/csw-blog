Comments are used in CS Workflow to provide feedback and communicate
about content.

Comments are displayed in the Comments tab on the right of the content
box.

Team members are able to make three types of comments:

* General comments.
* Comments that reference text in the content item.
* Replies to past comments.

###  General comments

General comments allow you to give general feedback on the content and
is the easiest way to comment.

1.  Type your feedback in the comment text box.
2.  Click the \'Add comment\' button.

###  Comments referencing text

This type of comment can be used to reference text in the content body
as well as content type attributes. The referenced text is shown as a
quote in the comment.

1.  Use your cursor to select the text you want to comment on. The text
    will appear above the comment text box. This reference can be
    removed by clicking the x on the right of the reference or replaced
    by selecting a new piece of text.
2.  Enter your feedback in the comment text box.
3.  Click the \'Add comment\' button.

When team members hover over the comment, the reference will be
highlighted in the content. If the referenced text is not in view in the
content box, i.e. the content is longer than the box view, click the
comment to scroll to the highlighted text.

###  Replies to comments

Replies allow you to respond to other team members\' comments.

1.  Click the \'reply\' link on the comment you want to respond to. You
    can cancel the reply by clicking the x on the right of the reply
    reference.
2.  Enter your comment in the comment text box.
3.  Click the \'Add comment\' button.

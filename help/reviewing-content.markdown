Content can be reviewed in CS Workflow when there is a user assigned to
the content who is a reviewer. The exception to this is the content
owner who, even if they are a reviewer, cannot review their own content.

When content is in the review stage it is unable to be edited; only
comments can be added.

If there is a previous version of the content, the differences between
the two versions are displayed. Green text indicates additions
and red text shows deletions.

Reviewers provide their feedback by [making comments](/help/comments/make-comments.html).
Reviewers are able to highlight sections of the text or the
content type attributes and make comments against these sections.

Once a review has been completed, the reviewer clicks the \'Finish
review\' button. This pushes the content to the Edit stage.

If there is more than one reviewer assigned to the content, content will
only move to the Edit stage when all reviews have been completed.

An admin or editor can manually move the content back to the edit stage,
if required.

Changing account plans cannot be done through the CS Workflow website.

To change your account\'s plan, send a request to [support@csworkflow.com](mailto:support@csworkflow.com).
We may be able to give you ways to avoid having to upgrade. Moving to a plan with restrictions could cause you to lose
content.

Only the current account contact can request this change.

2014 is going to be a busy year for CS Workflow. We've started this year continuing where we left off, by improving and building towards our official launch in a few months. Keep you eyes open for more news about our launch as we'll be rewarding our early adopters with a special introductory offer.

Here's an update about what changes we've made recently and what to expect in the coming weeks.

### Publishing to Wordpress
We're building CS Workflow to be the best and easiest way to get your content reviewed and approved. From the start we knew that the key to making it a useful part of your whole content process was connecting to other platforms and applications.

The first platform we are supporting is Wordpress. This integration will allow you to export your approved content to Wordpress when it is ready to go live. Setup is straightforward. Go to the Integrations tab in Settings, add a new Wordpress integration and simply enter your blog's URL. A new option will be available in your content export dropdown. The Wordpress export supports several options, including author, category and scheduled publishing.

Read the article about <a href="http://csworkflow.uservoice.com/knowledgebase/articles/305936-exporting-to-wordpress" target="_blank">exporting to Wordpress</a> for more information about setup and exporting options.

More integration options will be coming soon.

### Email notification preferences
You now have control over the notification emails you receive from CS Workflow. You can set whether you want to receive the alerts immediately, as part of your daily activity digest, or not at all.

Email notification preferences can be set for comments on content you own, replies to your comments, workflow updates for content you are assigned to, and requests for you to edit, review or approve content.

The default setting is to send requests immediately with all other notifications added to your daily digest. To change the default, click your user icon in the top left and then notification preferences in the menu.

### What's next
Over the next few weeks we'll be focusing on bug fixes, improving help documentation, and completing started features.

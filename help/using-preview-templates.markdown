Anyone is able to preview content using a preview template as long as the
[template has been added to the content](/help/content/add-preview-template-to-content.html)
you want to preview.

How you preview content depends on your role:

* *Admin/Editors*\: Click on \'Actions\' and select Preview.
* *Reviewers/Approvers*\: Click on the \'Preview\' button at the top of the
  content box.

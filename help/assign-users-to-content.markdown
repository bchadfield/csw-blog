Only admins and editors are able to change the users assigned to a
content item.

The users assigned to a content item are those people who will be
directly involved in the preparation of that content for publication.

User avatars, found above the Comments tab, show which team members are
currently assigned to the content.

Hovering your mouse over a user\'s avatar will display their role(s)
(i.e. admin, editor, reviewer, approver).

Find out how to set default content assignments here \[LINK TO DEFAULT
ASSIGNMENTS\].

To change the users assigned to a content item:

1.  Open the content item in question.
2.  Click the + button to the right of the assigned users at the top
    right of the page.
3.  This will display the current members of the workspace. The
    checkboxes on the left most column show whether or not a team member
    is assigned to the content. The content owner\'s status can\'t be
    changed and their checkbox is disabled.
4.  Change the assigned users by checking or unchecking the checkboxes.
5.  Click Save to confirm your changes.

Tip: Make user changes before moving content into a different stage to
minimise confusion of assigned users. For example:

* Add/remove reviewers before sending for review.
* Add/remove approvers before sending for approval.
* Add/remove editors before sending for edit.

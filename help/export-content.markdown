Only admins and editors are able to export content.

Content must be in the Ready or Live stage before it can be exported.
Read about getting content to the Ready and Live stage \[LINKS\].

To export your content:

1.  Open the content item you want to export.
2.  Click the \'Export\' button at the top of the content box to view
    your export options.
3.  Select the export option you want.

The default options are export to Markdown, HTML and plain text. This downloads the content in the selected format.

Any publishing integrations you have setup \[link to creating integrations\] will appear as export options.

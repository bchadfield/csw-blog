Content types allow you to customise your content. Content types can be
used to add additional attributes to your content or as a way to tag
your content as being of a particular type.

Only admins are able to add and manage content types.

To set up a new content type:

1.  Go to Settings and click the Content types tab.
2.  The Content types tab shows all the content types that exist in your
    workspace. Three content types exist by default: email, blog and
    tweet.
3.  Click the \'Add content type\' button. This will bring up the New
    content type form.
4.  Enter a name for your content type. This is how it will be
    identified when new content is created.
    * Add the properties of the content type. There are two types of
      properties: attribute (a text value, like an email subject line)
      and rule (a word or character count).
    * Add more properties by clicking the \'Add property button\'. There
      is no maximum or minimum number of properties you can have.
    * Unwanted properties can be deleted by clicking the associated
      \'Remove\' button.

5.  Click the \'Save content type\' button to confirm your changes.

The content type will now be available to be assigned to content items.

###  Adding attributes

Enter the name you want call your attribute, e.g. Author. The
attribute\'s name will appear in all content that uses the content type.

You also have the option of adding a default value for the attribute,
e.g. Joe Blogs. If you enter a default value, this attribute will be
pre-populated in content that uses the content type.

###  Adding rules

Rules are defined by the operator, value and count type.

You have the option of limiting character or word counts, e.g. a tweet
will have the rule \'Up to and including 140 characters\'.

When editing content with a content type rule, a counter will indicate
if you are meeting the rule.

There are no consequences in CS Workflow for breaking a rule you\'ve
set, such as not being able to save.

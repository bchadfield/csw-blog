Only admins and editors are able to delete content.

Deleting a content item permanently removes the content, its versions
and comments from your workspace. This is an irreversible action.

As there is no limit to the number of content items a workspace can
store, we recommend archiving content that is no longer progressing
through the workflow, e.g. published or stalled content.

To delete content:



1.  Open the content item you
    want to delete.
2.  Click on the \'Actions\'
    button at the top of the content box and select <span
    style="line-height: 1.42857143;">\'Delete\' from the drop
    down.
3.  Confirm you want to delete
    the content.



The content item, its versions and comments are now permanently deleted
from your workspace.

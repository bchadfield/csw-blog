Only admins or assigned editors are able to change content settings.

To change a content\'s preview template:

1.  Open the content item you wish to change.
2.  If the content doesn\'t currently have a preview template, click the
    Actions button and select Add preview template. If the
    content already has a preview template click the Actions button
    and select Edit.
3.  Select the preview template you want from the drop down. If you
    select the blank field this will remove the preview template.
4.  Click Save.

You can now preview the content. How you preview content depends on your
role:

* *Admin/Editors*: Click on Actions and select Preview.
* *Reviewers/Approvers*: Click on the Preview button at the top of the content box.

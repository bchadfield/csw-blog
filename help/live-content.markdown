The Live stage is the final stage of the workflow and indicates that the
content has been approved and is now published. There are some scenarios
where content is not published, for example support email templates, so
the Live stage can also be used to show the content is complete and in
use.

Only admin and assigned editors are able to manually move ready content
to Live.

The following export options are available to content in the Ready
stage:

* Export to Markdown, HTML, or plain text
* Publish to an integrated platform \[link to integrations section\]

Content that has gone live can also be moved back to the Draft stage if
updates or changes are required. Putting live content into Draft moves
it back to the start of the workflow and saves it as a new version.
